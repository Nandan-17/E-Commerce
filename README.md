- Customer information (CustomerID, Country)  

The notebook walks through the process of:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Sales and customer segmentation analysis  
- Visualization of sales performance across countries, time, and categories  
- Profitability insights  
The goal is to understand e-commerce sales dynamics and support data-driven decision making.
